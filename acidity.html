                                have...</span>
								
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
						    <br>Acidity is one of the most common ailments that almost everyone experiences once in their lifetimes. In simple terms, it is a condition that causes excess acid production in the stomach. This not only causes discomfort in the stomach but also leads to other symptoms, such as a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and <a href="https://www.1mg.com/diseases/indigestion-60?utm_medium=Acidity_overview_direct_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">indigestion</a>.&nbsp;
						  </p>
						  
						        
								<div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Symptoms Of Acidity<br><br>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The symptoms of acidity occur when some of the acid content of the stomach flows back up into the esophagus or the food pipe, which connects the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) acts as a valve that lets food enter the stomach but does not allow it back up into the esophagus. When this valve fails to function properly, stomach contents are regurgitated into the esophagus and the following symptoms of acidity can be experienced:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1. Heartburn</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the name, heartburn has nothing to do with the heart. It is a common symptom of acidity that is caused when the excess stomach acid leaks out into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. This feeling can last for a few minutes to several hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2. Regurgitation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Some people with acidity may experience regurgitation. It is a feeling in which the person may feel liquid undigested food, bile, or stomach acid moving up and down in the throat. This sensation is somewhat similar to the feeling of being pukish and usually occurs post meals, exercising, or bending right after eating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3. Sour taste in the mouth</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Another common symptom of stomach ailments, a sour taste in the mouth, is also a symptom of acidity. It happens when food, along with stomach acid and bile, rises up to the back of your throat, causing a bitter taste. This usually happens along with regurgitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">4. Difficulty in swallowing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Difficulty in swallowing, also known as dysphagia, happens when excess acid in the stomach causes a feeling of fullness. It also causes a delay in the movement of food through the food pipe and impedes digestion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">5. Sore throat</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When the stomach acid moves up to the mouth it can irritate the vocal cords or the voice box, leading to sore throat or hoarseness.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">6. Indigestion</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, can also be a key sign of acidity and other digestive problems. It can lead to a feeling of discomfort and a burning sensation in the upper middle part of the stomach.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>Heartburn is often confused as a symptom of heart attack. <br>Read the article to know the difference bewteen angina, heartburn, and heart attack.</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;<br><a contenteditable="false" href="https://www.1mg.com/articles/is-it-angina-heartburn-or-heart-attack-know-the-difference/?utm_medium=Acidity_symptoms_1_cta_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page"></a><br><br></strong></em></p></div>



                           <div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Treatment Of Acidity<br><br>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The medications used to treat heartburn work either by blocking the production&nbsp; or aiding in the neutralization of the stomach acid. Based on their action mechanism, these drugs are classified into three main categories, namely:&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Antacids</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Antacids, also known as stomach acid neutralizers, neutralize the stomach acid to provide quick relief from acidity. These are available in the form of tablets as well as syrups. <br><strong><br>Examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/aluminium-hydroxide-209348?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Aluminum hydroxide</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/magnesium-hydroxide-405639?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_1&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Magnesium hydroxide</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/magnesium-trisilicate-210211?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_2&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Magnesium trisilicate</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/magnesium-carbonate-211292?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_3&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Magnesium carbonate</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/calcium-carbonate-211246?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_4&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Calcium carbonate</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The side effects of antacids are based on their ingredients. For example, antacids containing aluminum hydroxide might cause constipation as a side effect, whereas those containing magnesium hydroxide can lead to diarrhea. The long-term effects include gas (belching), swelling of the feet and hands, <a href="https://www.1mg.com/diseases/constipation-61?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_5&amp;utm_source=disease_page">constipation</a>, and diarrhea.<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. H2-receptor blockers&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">These medications block specific receptors on the stomach cells that release gastric acids, thereby helping fight acidity. They are also known to aid in the treatment of damaged tissues in the stomach caused by <a href="https://www.1mg.com/diseases/peptic-ulcer-disease-719?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_6&amp;utm_source=disease_page">peptic ulcers</a>, gastritis, or stomach inflammation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the common side effects of drugs belonging to H2-receptor blockers class include abdominal pain and diarrhea. These drugs should not be taken by pregnant women as they can cause abortion and teratogenic (fetal defects) side effects. <br><strong><br>Examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/famotidine-209866?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_7&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Famotidine</a></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Nizatidine</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">PPIs block and reduce the production of stomach acid to relieve acidity. They are available both as over-the-counter and prescription drugs. These drugs are usually prescribed to people who do not show any improvement post diet and lifestyle changes or experience gastric symptoms regularly.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br>Side effects of these medications are rare but may include <a href="https://www.1mg.com/diseases/headache-192?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_9&amp;utm_source=disease_page">headache</a>, diarrhea, and upset stomach. The long-term health effects of these medicines are not yet known, so talk to your doctor if you are taking PPIs for a long time or in high doses. <br><strong><br>Examples include:</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Coating drugs</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Coating drugs, also known as ulcer protective drugs, protect the esophagus and stomach by forming a protective layer over the surface. These drugs are mostly recommended for short-term action and considered to be safe. <br><br>They are mostly recommended for use in people suffering from stomach ulcers and peptic ulcer disease. <br><strong><br>Examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/sucralfate-210748?utm_medium=Acidity_treatment_10_direct_link_15&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Sucralfate</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Carbenoxolone</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Colloidal bismuth (CBS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Prokinetic drugs</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This class of drugs are prescription drugs and are known to act by promoting normal contraction of the esophagus and helping in the emptying of the stomach. <br><br>These are commonly recommended for people with GERD and mostly in combination with medications that lower acid production in the body, such as PPIs and H2-receptor blockers.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some common side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, drowsiness, and agitation. <br><strong><br>Examples of drugs belonging to this class are:</strong></p>

								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
						    <br>Arthritis is a common condition that affects joints and bones (especially the knees, elbows, wrists, and ankle). The symptoms of arthritis usually appear gradually or sometimes may appear suddenly. The signs and symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, swelling of the joints, decrease in range of motion of joints, or redness of the skin around the joint.
							<br><br>
							There are different causes depending on the type of arthritis. The most common types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Risk factors for arthritis include family history, old age, previous joint injury, obesity, smoking etc.
							
							<br><br>
							The main goal of treatment is to reduce pain, prevent any additional damage to the joints and improve joint mobility. Management includes the use of medications, surgery, weight management and exercises.
						  </p>
						  
						        
								<div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Causes Of Arthritis<br><br>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are different causes depending on the type of arthritis. The most common types are:<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1. Osteoarthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness and results in the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2. Rheumatoid arthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3. Gout</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Gout is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in your joints. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">4. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16. This type of arthritis can cause serious complications, such as growth problems, joint damage and eye inflammation.<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">5. Ankylosing spondylitis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of chronic arthritis that causes inflammation in certain parts of the spine.This causes pain and stiffness in the lower back and hips, especially in the morning and after periods of inactivity.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">6. Psoriatic arthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Psoriatic arthritis&nbsp; is a chronic, autoimmune form of arthritis that causes joint inflammation and occurs with the skin condition psoriasis. Psoriasis causes red, scaly rashes and thick, pitted fingernails.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">7. Reactive arthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Reactive arthritis is pain or swelling in a joint that is caused by an infection in your body. It causes extremely painful, swollen joints and the person feels very tired.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">8. Septic arthritis</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis, and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus or fungus. This type of arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty in&nbsp; the affected joint. The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever.&nbsp;</p></div>


  <div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Symptoms Of Arthritis<br><br>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While it is difficult to know for sure if your joint pain is due to arthritis or not, based on the symptoms, there are certain signs that usually indicate you should consult a doctor. The four key signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pain:</strong> Pain from arthritis can be constant or it may come and go. It may occur when at rest or while moving. Pain may be in one part of the body or in many different parts.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Swelling:</strong> Some types of arthritis cause the skin over the affected joint to become red and swollen, feeling warm to the touch. Swelling that lasts for three days or longer or occurs more than three times a month should prompt a visit to the doctor.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stiffness:</strong> This is a classic arthritis symptom, especially when waking up in the morning or after sitting at a desk or riding in a car for a long time. Morning stiffness that lasts longer than an hour is a good reason to suspect arthritis.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Difficulty in mobility:</strong> If you find it hard or painful to get up from your favorite chair, or after sitting in a single position for a long time, then it could be a warning sign of arthritis.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

                   <div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Treatment Of Arthritis<br><br>
</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">1. Medications</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are used to treat pain and inflammation and decrease joint damage.Some examples of drugs are: <a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/ibuprofen-210020?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/aspirin-209321?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_1&amp;utm_source=disease_page">aspirin</a>, and <a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/naproxen-210330?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_2&amp;utm_source=disease_page">naproxen</a>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Steroids are given to manage symptoms of arthritis, mainly pain and inflammation. These drugs also help in improving the range of motion by managing the symptoms.Steroids like <a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/prednisolone-210551?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_3&amp;utm_source=disease_page">prednisolone</a>, <a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/betamethasone-209445?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_4&amp;utm_source=disease_page">betamethasone</a>, and<a href="https://www.1mg.com/generics/dexamethasone-209699?utm_medium=Arthritis_treatment_9_direct_link_5&amp;utm_source=disease_page"> dexamethasone </a>are used in inflammation.&nbsp;</p>

								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
						    <br>Back pain is one of the most common pain complaints that almost everyone has had at some point in their lives. This pain is felt in the back of the body, stretching from the shoulders to the hips. <br><br>

Back pain can be either acute or chronic. When pain strikes suddenly and lasts for a few days, it is referred to as "acute." Symptoms are typically sudden and transient. Chronic back pain lasts for more than three months and returns regularly, making daily activities difficult.<br><br>

Increasing age is a significant risk factor for back pain. Factors like injuries, inactive lifestyle, poor posture, illness, strains, injuries, and fractures can contribute to back pain.<br><br>

It can be prevented by lifestyle modifications, like being physically active, losing excess body weight, maintaining good posture, managing stress, and getting adequate good quality sleep. <br><br>

Most cases of back pain can be managed by over the counter medications and topical ointments. However, in case of chronic back pain, it is important to seek medical treatment to avoid long-term complications.

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Back pain usually improves after a month of home treatment. Back pain is a complex ailment that affects everyone differently. Many people's discomfort lasts for months, but only a few people suffer chronic, severe pain. In such case, various types of treatment can provide relief such as:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Heat and cold treatments</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">These treatments are recommended to relieve aching pain by applying a hot compress or an ice pack to the sore spot. To stimulate blood flow and healing, use a cold pack for the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury, then switch to heat therapy. Packs should not be worn for longer than 20 minutes at a time.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Medications&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Pain relievers sold over the counter (OTC) and various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help provide relief.</p>
